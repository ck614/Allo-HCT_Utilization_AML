# About
* Codes for "Disparities in Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Among Acute Myeloid Leukemia Patients"
* The objectives were to: 1) identify patient-, facility-, and community-level variables associated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Allo-HCT) receipt, and 2) evaluate whether disparities associated with these factors have narrowed over time.
# Data

* Data was retreived from the National Cancer Database for patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) between 2004 and 2021.
* N = 94,246
  
# Methods
* An adjusted mixed logistic regression model was used to identify patient-, facility-, and community-level variables associated with Allo-HCT utilization.
* Multiple adjusted mixed linear regression models were utilized to understand trends in Allo-HCT utilization across variables identified as associated with All-HCT from the mixed logistic regression model.

# Tables and Figures
* All codes used to generate tables and figures were included in the Allo-HCT_Final.rmd file.
* A new sheet "Forest plot" in the Excel file was manually created from the exported results in the previous sheets and was used to generate the forest plot.
