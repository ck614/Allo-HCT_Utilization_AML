# About
* Codes for "Disparities in Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Among Acute Myeloid Leukemia Patients"
* The objectives were to evaluate whether disparities associated with the significant predictors of Allo-HCT have narrowed over time.
# Data

* Data was retreived from the National Cancer Database for patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) between 2004 and 2019.
* N = 85,787
  
# Methods
* An adjusted mixed logistic regression model was used to identify demographic, socioeconomic status, and healthcare access variables associated with Allo-HCT utilization.
* Multiple adjusted mixed linear regression models were utilized to understand trends in Allo-HCT utilization across variables identified as associated with All-HCT from the mixed logistic regression model.

# Tables and Figures
* Codes used to generate tables and figures were included in theÂ Codes/Allo-HCT_Main file.
* A new sheet "Forest plot" in the Excel file was manually created from the exported results in the previous sheets and was used to generate the forest plot.
